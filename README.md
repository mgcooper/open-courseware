# open-courseware
A place to keep track of open-source courseware that I find useful.

## hydrology
[Introduction to Hydrology](https://margulis-group.github.io/teaching/)  
Professor Steve Margulis (UCLA). A freely-available hydrology textbook with an accompanying Matlab toolbox / hydrologic model.

[Terrestrial Hydrometeorology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119951933)  
Professor W. James Shuttleworth (University of Arizona). This is a great resource on land-surface hydrology / meteorology. If you cannot access it at the link above, it shoudl be freely-available [here](http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&bcsId=6961&itemId=0470659378). 

## climate science
[Introduction to Climate Science](https://open.oregonstate.education/climatechange/)  
Professor Andreas Schmittner (Oregon State University). A great freely-available textbook on climate science.

[Introduction to climate dynamics and climate modelling](http://www.climate.be/textbook/)  
Professor Schmittner offers a second free resource on quantitative approaches to studying earth's climate. It appears to also be [available here](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/climatology-and-climate-change/climate-system-dynamics-and-modelling?format=PB)  

## optics / radiative transfer
[Ocean Optics](https://www.oceanopticsbook.info)  
Curtis Mobley (PhD, Sequoia Scientific, Inc.). This is a digital 'book' of notes / papers / resources about the quantitative study of ocean optics. Basically a free textbook in a digital format.  

[Radiative Heat Transfer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123869449/radiative-heat-transfer#book-info)  
Professor Michael Modest (UC Merced). In my quest to learn RT, this was the most helpful textbook I found. It is comprehensive and includes coupled thermodynamics / radiative equilibrium. Although not free/open-source, I think this can be obtained for free on most academic institutional servers.  

[Scattport](https://scattport.org)
A website dedicated to the quantitative study of light scattering. Lots of great tools and resources are available here.  

## thermodynamics / heat and mass transfer
[Thermopedia](http://www.thermopedia.com/navigation/)  
Like wikipedia, but for thermodynamics. Basically a digital textbook.  

## applied math
[Professor Gilbert Strang, MIT](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/)  
Professor Strang has posted the lectures for many of his classes and they are very good.
